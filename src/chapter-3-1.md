Understanding Emotional Intelligence

Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and manage one's own emotions, as well as understand and influence the emotions of others. It involves empathy, self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, and social skills.

The Importance of Emotional Intelligence in Effective Leadership

Effective leadership requires more than just technical expertise or intelligence. It also requires emotional intelligence. Leaders who have high emotional intelligence are better able to:

* Build strong relationships with team members
